<!-- In this file, we have discussed about 4 tags
1. <table> tag, this is very important tag, while you creating
    any table then then content must be in this tag.
2. <tr> tag, this is known as table row tag.
    this depends on how many rows you are creating.
for every new row we should use new tr tag
3. <th> tag is known as table heading tag, according to this file,
    we have used 4 th tags. means we created 4 columns heading
4. <td> this like a column tag, here we have to enter content
    as per heading

Note: to understand this clearly just run this file-->
