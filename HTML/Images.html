<!-- this file is about images tag(img)-->
<!-- when you enter img tag, then automatically it gives two attributes-->
<!--
    1. src="" , in this attribute we have to insert the image file
    which is already in your pc. To insert file we have to type ./
    so when you type this, it will show, which image to add fom your files
    then select the required one
    Other way to insert the image is, just copy the image address
    from online and copy near src.

    Note: You will save this file in your pc right, in the same file you must have the image file.
